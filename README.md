# dotfiles

> From factory reset to coding in five minutes.

My personal Mac setup. One command to go from zero to a fully configured machine.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fmontes.com/install.sh | bash
```

This clones the repo to `~/.dotfiles` and runs the installer.

## What's included

- **Zsh** with Oh My Zsh, Starship prompt, autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, atuin history
- **Homebrew** packages and casks via `Brewfile`
- **Aliases** split by context — work aliases stay local, not committed
- **Git** with delta for diffs, gh-dash for PR reviews
- **mise** for managing Node, Python, and Java versions
- **[Fresh](https://getfresh.dev/)** for terminal code editing and browsing
- **[AI](ai/)** skills, instructions, and subagents for agentic coding harnesses
- **macOS defaults** for Dock, Finder, keyboard

## Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fmontes/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```

The script will:

1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools
2. Install Homebrew and all packages from `Brewfile`
3. Symlink all dotfiles to `~/`
4. Install Oh My Zsh
5. Set up mise and install Node and Python
6. Apply macOS defaults
7. Install gh-dash, global npm packages, fix permissions, set up the VS Code CLI
8. Sync AI agent config to every platform with `chai`

## After running install.sh

These steps require human interaction and can't be automated:

- Install **1Password** and sign in first
- Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"` and add to GitHub
- Update `~/.gitconfig` with your name and email
- Run `gh auth login`
- Run `atuin login` (optional, for cross-machine history sync)
- Sign in to Raycast to restore extensions

## Fresh

[Fresh](https://getfresh.dev/) is the terminal editor used for code editing and browsing. Launch with `fresh .` from any project. No config file fiddling required.

## AI

All AI agent config lives in [`ai/`](ai/) as a single source of truth:

- [`ai/instructions/`](ai/instructions/) — shared instructions (`AGENTS.md`)
- [`ai/skills/`](ai/skills/) — [agent skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) (one folder per skill)
- [`ai/subagents/`](ai/subagents/) — custom subagent definitions

### Syncing with chai

I author the config once and let [**chai**](https://github.com/charliesbot/chai) distribute it to every agent platform — Claude, Codex, Droid, OpenCode, and Antigravity — instead of hand-maintaining each one's config files. The manifest lives in [`home/chai.toml`](home/chai.toml) (symlinked to `~/chai.toml`).

`install.sh` runs `chai update && chai sync` for you, so a fresh machine is ready with no extra steps. Afterwards, the loop for changes is:

```bash
# 1. Edit the source of truth
$EDITOR ai/instructions/AGENTS.md      # or add a skill/subagent under ai/

# 2. Distribute to every platform listed in chai.toml
chai update   # clone/pull any external deps first (skills from other repos, etc.)
chai sync     # copy instructions, skills, and subagents into each platform's config dir
```

`chai sync` uses hash-based dirty detection: if an agent edited its copy, it prompts before overwriting. Add `--dry-run` to preview changes or `--force` to skip the dirty check. Because `ai/` is the only place you edit, every machine and every agent stays in sync from one commit.

Skills can also come from other people's repos. Declare them under `[deps]` in `chai.toml` — `chai update` clones each to `~/.chai/deps/`, and `[skills]` paths reference them with `@name`. Current external skills: [impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable), [frontend-slides](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/frontend-slides), and [dev-browser](https://github.com/sawyerhood/dev-browser).

### Installing a single skill elsewhere

The skills are also installable standalone in any project, without chai:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/fmontes/dotfiles/tree/main/ai --skill <skill-name>
```

See the [skills README](ai/skills/README.md) for the full list.

## Keeping Brewfile up to date

```bash
brew bundle dump --brews --casks --force --file=~/.dotfiles/Brewfile
```

Run this before committing whenever you install new tools.
